# data-visualization-project

## Introduction

This project uses solar radiation data from NASA's Data Access Viewer and the .shp polygons provided by INEGI to calculate each Mexican State's average solar radiation in one year. Then this information is compared to the energy consumption of each state reported by the CRE and plotted in an interactive scatter plot.

## Workflow

All the code needed for these calculations is contained in the workbook `energy_consumption_radiation_mexico.ipynb`.
All the raw data needed for these calculations can be found in the csv and excel files located in the main project folder.
